              The Delta Lab is an interdisciplinary, supportive, collaborative
              community of researchers focused on solving critical problems in
              the world through research. We come from a variety of disciplines
              -- human-computer interaction, learning sciences, design, computer
              science, psychology, and organizational behavior -- to publish
              design-based research in our respective fields. Our supportive
              community enables students to gain experience leading projects and
              publishing as first authors in top-tier venues. Through this
              experience, students become self-directed designers, researchers,
              and mentors who are well-positioned to become leading experts in
              their respective fields.
