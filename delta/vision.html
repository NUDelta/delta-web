            <h3>Delta Lab</h3>
                <p>Delta Lab is the first interdisciplinary research lab and design studio at Northwestern University. We study, design, and build systems in the domain of social and crowd computing, human computer interaction, learning sciences, civics, and innovation. The primary goal of the Delta Lab is to teach people how to be outstanding designers and researchers capable of building excellent theory and eloquent systems.  To achieve this goal, Delta Lab faculty work closely with a tightly knit cohort of doctoral students who have access to Northwestern’s entire human computer interaction community, which is one of the largest in the country. Students take classes in Computer Science, Engineering, Design, Education and Social Policy, Communities, Management, and Journalism to build a unique perspective on technology and social behavior.  Upon graduation, students push the boundaries of scholarship as professors at universities and researchers in industry labs and develop radically new technologies as designers and entrepreneurs in the tech industry.</p>
                <p class="font-small">Delta Lab projects are made possible through generously support from National Science Foundation grants in Cyberlearning, Cyber-Human Systems, iCrops, and the Research Initiation Initiative; a Hastac Digital Media Learning Grant supported by the MacArthur and Mozilla Foundations; a Microsoft FUSE Labs Research Award; Northwestern's Murphy Society Grant; and Northwestern's Office of the Provost Award for Digital Learning.</p>
