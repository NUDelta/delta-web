          Our vision is to transform the way we learn, play, work, and live to
          create the society in which we want to live. To achieve this vision we
          research and design systems in real world environments, and train the
          future generation of researchers and designers. The most important
          problems we need to tackle can&apos;t be solved by any one alone.

          Delta Lab is the first interdisciplinary research lab and design
          studio at Northwestern University. We study, design, and build systems
          in the domain of social and crowd computing, human computer
          interaction, learning sciences, civics, and innovation. The primary
          goal of the Delta Lab is to teach people how to be outstanding
          designers and researchers capable of building excellent theory and
          eloquent systems. To achieve this goal, Delta Lab faculty work closely
          with a tightly knit cohort of doctoral students who have access to
          Northwestern&apos;s entire human computer interaction community, which
          is one of the largest in the country. Students take classes in
          Computer Science, Engineering, Design, Education and Social Policy,
          Communities, Management, and Journalism to build a unique perspective
          on technology and social behavior. Upon graduation, students push the
          boundaries of scholarship as professors at universities and
          researchers in industry labs and develop radically new technologies as
          designers and entrepreneurs in the tech industry.
